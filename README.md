# Simple Value Iteration
A simple demonstration of the value iteration algorithm in C. This passive reinforcement learning algorithm is done on a simple 2D environment (with a goal and traps).

## Requires

This program requiere Gnuplot to plot values on screen

```
sudo apt-get install gnuplot
```

## Launch program

```
gcc -o value_iteration value_iteration.c
./value_iteration
```
